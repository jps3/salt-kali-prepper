# salt-kali-prepper

Masterless saltstack-based Kali preparation, configuration, and updates the way I like it to be before I begin working with it. This is also a means for me to learn saltstack. Suggestions and corrections welcome.

IPs and subnets are unique for machines spawned in VIP+ space so the utility of my maintaining the dnsmasq config seems a bit pointless. Not sure if I will keep that part up-to-date going forward or not.
